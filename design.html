              <h1>Genre</h1>
              <h2>
                  Platform fighting games are a subgenre of fighting games blended together with platforming games
                  and adopting aspects from them. They maintain the combo-based combat system that traditional fighting
                  games utilise but also add platformer aspects to it, such as collectibles and a variety of platform
                  focused stages, and stray from the usual knock-out win conditions that fighting games use; rather
                  opting to use other unconventional scoring methods. The games that are styled after this genre are
                  generally designed to have party-oriented elements, ideal for casual play in groups of up to four
                  players that can fight and cause mayhem in a small arena for fun.

                          When it comes to platform fighting games, the main title to look to for influence
                          is Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. This encompasses five different games, released
                          from 1999 through to 2018.  An innovation, the title brought together various
                          characters created by Nintendo and a number of its second-party developers over
                          a series of games to fight in different arenas, also given themes that drew
                          inspiration from other Nintendo titles. The aim of the game is for the player
                          to knock their opponents off the map by doing enough damage to them, unlike the
                          traditional health bar style that most fighting games adopt. This can be done by
                          utilising an extensive melee combat system with a large variety of combos and special
                          abilities – built and expanded throughout the series of games, increasing in complexity
                          with each one. If an opponent is knocked off the map they will lose a life and then respawn,
                          and the game continues until only one character is left alive. The game is playable both
                          against the computer AI as well as against up to four other players but was predominantly
                          designed as a multiplayer game, something which garnered Nintendo a lot of praise and even
                          resulted in a large competitive community being built around it.

                        Brawlhalla is a title developed by Blue Mammoth and released in April 2014. Following in the steps of Super Smash Bros, it is owned by Ubisoft that
                        plays similarly to the previous title examined. The aim is for the player to deal enough damage to their opponents so as to knock them
                        off the map through the use of simple controls and one-button special moves, as well as various player mobility options such as double-jumping and
                        different kinds of dodges and dashes. Brawlhalla is worth noting for two reasons. The first is the fact that the game has a large and ever increasing
                        roster of unique characters (over 40) – each of which has different amounts of the four statistics the game has (Strength, Dexterity, Defense and Speed)
                        assigned to them – a factor which is key for games of this type in keeping the player base’s interest by providing them with new and fresh aspects to play with.
                        Secondly it has an interesting weapon system, where different weapons drop from the sky for players to pick up, with each player being able to
                        hold 2 weapons from a pool of 12. This makes for an interesting challenge, as the players must formulate their game strategy around what weapons
                        game matches less repetitive. One of the main reasons of selecting this game is because it is so famous, there are even world championships where
                        teams fight each other every year.

                          A game heavily influenced by Super Smash Bros., Rivals of Aether was released for Microsoft Windows
                          and had gameplay mechanics heavily based on those of Nintendo’s title. The game has ‘lower’ graphics
                          quality, opting to go for pixelated characters and environment, compared to a higher definition, ‘cartoony’
                          look and has basic combat mechanics. What makes it stand out is the interesting and unique feature that appears
                          in the combat. The characters of the game each get their theme from a different element and so each one has its own
                          special elemental attack. The interesting part is that – and subsequently part of what made it a successful game in
                          its own right – these elemental attacks can also affect the game’s stage, a mechanic which is enticing and can make

                          Produced by indie developer Messhof, Nidhogg 2 takes a different approach to platform fighting games.
                          Instead of using a traditional scoring system of point scoring or kill count, two players are placed
                          in the arena for a pre-specified amount of time. During this time the players must sway the ‘balance bar’
                          in their favour by getting kills on the other player, making use of the multiple weapons – both close combat
                          and ranged – that can be picked up around the stage. The one who has control of the ‘balance bar’ when the time
                          runs out is the winner. The artistic style of the game is also interesting as, despite being mostly minimalistic
                          and ‘lower quality’ than other similar games, it has depth and pays attention to smaller details that make it unique.

                          An interesting case, TowerFall Ascension does not use the traditional approach to platform fighting games.
                          The title, produced by the indie company Matt Makes Games, is a platform, fighting, and battle royale game
                          where up to four players are placed in an arena with a bow and a limited supply of arrows and the last one
                          alive is the winner. Arrows can be replenished by picking up the ones that have already been shot around
                          the map and there are also various buffs (shield, speed, etc.) that can be found in the form of pickups
                          scattered throughout the stage. The stage style used in TowerFall Ascension is also different; compared
                          to traditional platformers, the maps are separated into rooms that are conjoined rather than having multiple
                          separate smaller platforms to break up the playing space.

          <h1>From Research to Game Design</h1>

          <h2>
              After looking through a number of examples a theme for the game was decided, drawing inspiration from many of them.
              The game that was created for the project is a platformer fighting game, where the two or more players are placed in
              an arena and they must fight to eliminate each other. The players utilise ranged abilities that fire projectiles which
              take away a life if they collide with the opponent. Each player has three lives in total and loses once all of them have reached zero.
              Each player also has their own kill count. After the first kill the normal projectiles – which do one point of damage – are replaced by
              an empowered version that do two points of damage, making it easier for them to take out opponents.
              The players can move and jump around the various platform of the map to dodge their opponent and gain a tactical advantage over them.
              While doing this they must also avoid suffering environmental damage from the rocks that fall from the ceiling at regular intervals.
              These rocks will do a single point of damage if they graze a player but will take off two lives if the player does no move out of the way in time.
              The art style chosen for the game was simplistic. It was evident from the research that high quality visuals are not what makes a game
              and many people find the 32-bit style adopted by most platformers endearing.  The level is built to look like an underground dungeon
              and the characters are magic wielding heroes.

              In a different reality, humans have been forced underground due to a massive surge of magic that decimated the planet’s surface.
              The surviving populations have formed underground nations to survive, but have now realised that resources are limited. Rather
              than going to war for them, each city has put forth a powerful champion; humans who somehow did not get lost in the magical storm,
              but emerged from it with immense power gained from harnessing the magic. These champions are pitted against each other to fight for
              their city and gain the much needed resources for their people to survive. As one such champion, the player must enter the arena and
              fight for the honour of their people.

          <h2>
              The game shows promise and could in the future be expanded upon. The first steps
              to take would be to focus on specific features that should be worked on first. A
              possible major change would be a character roster system could be implemented,
              giving the players more freedom with what they decide to play as. Finally, multiple
              stages could be introduced, to avoid the monotony of only playing in one. After the
              more straightforward improvements have been made, further gameplay changes could be
              made. This would include additions such as different types of magic attacks and possibly
              even special attacks – unique to each character – as a game such as this is limited only
              by the imagination.
